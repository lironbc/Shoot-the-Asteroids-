# Shoot The Asteroids

A fun, fast paced space shooter developed entirely in python using pygame. Shoot the asteroids with your lasers to gain points and
avoid being hit to survive. Grab the powerups to maximize your points and put your name on the leaderboard!

## Installing

To install Shoot The Asteroids, go to the "Installer" directory, left click on "Shoot_The_Asteroids_Installer.exe" and click download on the right side of the screen. Next, run the installation launcher and follow the prompts. In the downloaded directory, run "Shoot The Asteroids.exe" and enjoy!

## Warning

Since this game doesn't have many downloads, your computer's defender might flag it as untrustworthy. The solution to this is that either many people download it therefore making it trustworthy or paying a fee to have it validated. I just wanted to share something I made but I understand if you feel unsafe downloading it. All code is publicly available for you to review if you would like to validate before downloading it. 

If you are downloading it, here are the instructions for Windows:

When downloading in chrome, you will need to click the carrot on the right of the download icon and click "keep" if chrome tries to remove the download. If Windows Defender tries to prevent the installer from running, click more info and then click "Run anyways".
